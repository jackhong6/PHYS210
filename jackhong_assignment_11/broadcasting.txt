1 a = np.arange(5)                    # VALID
2 b = np.random.random(4)             # VALID
3 c = np.arange(20).reshape((4,5))    # VALID
4
5 d=a+b  #INVALID: a has 5 elements and b has 4. Cannot be broadcast together. Must make a and b the same size. (Maybe append 0 to end of b)
6 e=a+c  #VALID: a is broadcast to match c
7 f=b*c  #INVALID: Cannot broadcast together with shapes (4,) (4,5). Must make b the same size as c. (Python is performing element by element multiplication.)
8 g=c.T*b #VALID


If a,b,c are matrices:
a = np.mat(a)
b = np.mat(b)
c = np.mat(c)

d=a+b  #INVALID: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (1,5) (1,4). Must make a and b same size. (Maybe append 0 to end of b)
e=a+c  #VALID
f=b*c  #VALID: Matrix multiplication performed
g=c.T*b #INVALID: shapes (5,4) and (1,4) not aligned: 4 (dim 1) != 1 (dim 0). (g=c.T*b.T works though.)
