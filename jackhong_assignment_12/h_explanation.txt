“For which values of h does your function become inaccurate?”

Well, that depends on what you mean by inaccurate. The plot in error_vs_h.pdf
shows that the optimal h for this numerical differentiation method with f(x)=sin(x)+10x
is around 1e-5. The error then increases following a power relationship (since the figure
is a log-log plot) on either side of the optimal h.
