The maximum velocity is 1424.304813 km/h.
The time when max velocity is reached is 56.255000 s.
The final velocity on the ground is 4.978040 m/s.
The total duration of the jump is 545.298000 s.

The velocity increases a lot at the beginning because gravity accelerates the
jumper towards the Earth and the atmosphere is too thin and the velocity too
slow for air drag to be a significant factor in opposing gravity. The velocity
starts to decrease even before the parachute opens because the atmosphere
becomes thicker and the jumper's velocity faster so that air drag becomes
greater than gravity and the acceleration then points upwards.
