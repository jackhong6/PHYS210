The plot in brownianscatter.pdf shows a clearly linear relationship between
the distance squared and time. This implies Einstein's prediction that
dispersion (distance) scales with the square root of time.

From the equation given in the project instructions, <r^2> = 2Dt, the slope of
the plot of <r^2> vs t is 2D.

slope = 0.000557 = 2D  --> D = 0.000279
